# Huffman Encoding Implementation with Radix Tree/Trie Data Structure

This project showcases the practical application of Huffman Coding using Radix Tree/Trie Data Structure. The Trie structure, known for efficient string storage and retrieval, contributes to fast lookup times and space efficiency. Huffman Coding, a lossless data compression algorithm, optimally encodes and decodes data strings. The user-friendly interface provides seamless interaction with compression and decompression functionalities.
